# Welcome to the UVIC ROBOTICS Utility page
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Uvic-Robotics-Club/Utilities.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Uvic-Robotics-Club/Utilities)

## What this repository is supposed to be

This will be the home for all of the utility classes or files that we will use for the club activities.

## Current Activities

Current projects include:
- xbox 360 wrapper (python)
- GUI to control the arm 
- Arm class for inverse kinematics as well as forward kinematics

## Who do I talk to?
To get things approved for use on the rover talk to Greg, He is the software coordinator and must approve any/all files.

## Revision control
To make sure we keep track of everything thats going on the rover we are implementing a basic revision control in 3 groups.

### REVISION 1
This is unapproved by the software lead, this is for WIP Items. Things that are in this category might not even compile. To get a rev 1 file to rev 2 it needs to be well commented, have a wiki page, clearly indicate sources (for math or datasheets), and must fit with the current setup ie. must not conflict with any rev 2 or rev 3 designs. Meeting all of these critera, you can contact the software lead and only he can approve something to rev 2 or higher.

### REVISION 2
This is approved by our software lead for use on the rover. However things in revision 2 have not been testing with the sensors on the rover. So think of this revision as good to go, but untested with hardware.

### REVISION 3
This is after it has passed the hardware integration tests. So it is confirmed and working. Only things in revision 3 will be on the final rover.
